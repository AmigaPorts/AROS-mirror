Stefan Berger and Georg Steger are working on the Palm port.  It already
boots xcopilot and POSE off a ROM image and displays some windows at
incredible speeds: The Screen bars's title "Workbench Screen" is drawn
at 5 sec. per char ;-).  Obviously the graphics driver needs some
improvement - now everything is done only via PutPixel() and GetPixel().

Sebastian Bauer is permanently doing more work on Zune.
