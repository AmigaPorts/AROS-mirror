Stefan Berger and Georg Steger are working on the Palm port.  It already
boots xcopilot and POSE off a ROM image and displays some windows at
incredible speeds: The Screen bars's title "Workbench Screen" is drawn
at 5 sec. per char ;-).  Obviously the graphics driver needs some
improvement - now everything is done only via PutPixel() and GetPixel().

Our MUI engine, based on Zune, is steadly but costantly improving,
thanks to Sebastian Bauer. Much more classes are done and working now!
This MUI engine is being developed on AmigaOS, rather than AROS, and
this means two important things:

    * the AROS compatibility with the AmigaOS API is tested and bettered

    * Soon AmigaOS will get an Open Source clone of MUI :)
