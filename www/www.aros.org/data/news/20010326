Stefan Berger committed the sources for gtlayout.library and improved
archtool further. He also added some stubs for the pool functions in
exec which old code (for example, the gtlayout.library) expect. Seems
like we need a way to "deprecate" an API :-) He began to port
gtlayout.library to AROS.

Georg Steger committed an AVI anim with a rotating floppy disk.
