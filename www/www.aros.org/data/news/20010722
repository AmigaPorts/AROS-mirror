Henning Kiel improved the mmakefile for C:Format and made memspeed use
the shared c.lib. He also fixed some bogous lib.conf files, endtag
generation and archtool doesn't modify case when auto-filling in
libbasetype and libbasetypeptr anymore.

Sebastian Heutling fixed two bugs in trackdisk.device and optimized
createNewEntry() in the AFFS code.

Fabio Alemagna moved all shell commands into a subdirectory if their
own. The ide.device has now complete 64bit support (which means we can
support *large* harddisks :-)
