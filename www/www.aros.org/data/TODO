TODO

- Split the code which generates the pages into separate scripts and
use a "config database" (probably a python object which is accessed
via cPickle) to create the inter-links.

o Convert the C source files into hyperlinked HTML docs.
    - Generate lxr.conf from site.conf.

o Add support for AutoDocs.
    - Navigation in the autodocs is clumsy: prev/next is missing,
	"Top" doesn't move to the library

- Think about a way to update the news section remotely (CGI ? Form ?
EMail ?)

- Publish the changelogs on the web.

- the mailto-link for e.g. cvs-passwords could look like this :

    <a href="mailto:digulla@aros.org?subject=Access to AROS CVS
    Server&body=Please add [my_login] [password]</a>

- List of links:
    - Homepages
    - Less related

- Merge old docs

DONE

* Create a list of contributors and publish it

* If a news item is very long, include only part of it in the news page
and create a sub-page with the rest of the text.
-> Solution: Write smaller news items :-) This should be simple by
updating the news section more regularily.

* Move the graph generation out of gensite into the makefile and make
it optional. This probably includes creating a way to make every
aspect of the site optional (screenshots, etc).
-> Just define GNUPLOT to empty or don't define it at all and the graphs
will not be generated.
