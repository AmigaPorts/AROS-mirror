TODO

- Split the code which generates the pages into separate scripts and
use a "config database" (probably a python object which is accessed
via cPickle) to create the inter-links.

o Convert the C source files into hyperlinked HTML docs.
    - Generate lxr.conf from site.conf.

- Add support for AutoDocs.

- Think about a way to update the news section remotely (CGI ? Form ?
EMail ?)

DONE

* If a news item is very long, include only part of it in the news page
and create a sub-page with the rest of the text.
-> Solution: Write smaller news items :-) This should be simple by
updating the news section more regularily.

* Move the graph generation out of gensite into the makefile and make
it optional. This probably includes creating a way to make every
aspect of the site optional (screenshots, etc).
-> Just define GNUPLOT to empty or don't define it at all and the graphs
will not be generated.
