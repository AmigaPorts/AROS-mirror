TODO

- Make the current item in the navbar stand out

- Make a logo contest

- Add Link to edenmarket (those guys host our server for free :-)

- Split the code which generates the pages into separate scripts and
use a "config database" (probably a python object which is accessed
via cPickle) to create the inter-links.

o Convert the C source files into hyperlinked HTML docs.
    - Generate lxr.conf from site.conf.

o Add support for AutoDocs.
    - Navigation in the autodocs is clumsy: prev/next is missing,
	"Top" doesn't move to the library
    * See also is useless

- Think about a way to update the news section remotely (CGI ? Form ?
EMail ?)

- Publish the changelogs on the web.

o Merge old docs
    - core.src
    - devinfo_inside.src
    - devinfo_outside.src
    - differences.src
    - faq.src
    - filesys.src
    - hidd-intro.src
    - hidd-model.src
    - hidd.src
    - ideas.src
    - included.src
    - missing.src
    - style.src

- Mirror Matts Diskimage

DONE

* List of links:
    * Homepages
    * Less related

* the mailto-link for e.g. cvs-passwords could look like this :

    <a href="mailto:digulla@aros.org?subject=Access to AROS CVS
    Server&body=Please add [my_login] [password]</a>

* Create a list of contributors and publish it

* If a news item is very long, include only part of it in the news page
and create a sub-page with the rest of the text.
-> Solution: Write smaller news items :-) This should be simple by
updating the news section more regularily.

* Move the graph generation out of gensite into the makefile and make
it optional. This probably includes creating a way to make every
aspect of the site optional (screenshots, etc).
-> Just define GNUPLOT to empty or don't define it at all and the graphs
will not be generated.
