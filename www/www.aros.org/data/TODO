- If a news item is very long, include only part of it in the news page
and create a sub-page with the rest of the text.

- Split the code which generates the pages into separate scripts and
use a "config database" (probably a python object which is accessed
via cPickle) to create the inter-links.

- Move the graph generation out of gensite into the makefile and make
it optional. This probably includes creating a way to make every
aspect of the site optional (screenshots, etc).

- Convert the C source files into hyperlinked HTML docs

- Add support for AutoDocs.
